If you find brian useful for your research, please cite this reference accordingly. 

brian uses several packages that **should also be acknowledged in their own right.** 
The following Tex-formatted acknowledgment is one way to do so::

    This research has made use of \textsc{brian}, a Python module to post-process data 
    cubes from integral field spectrographs. \textsc{brian} relies on \textsc{statsmodel} 
    (Seabold & Perktold 2010), \textsc{ppxf} (Cappellari & Emsellem 2004), 
    \textsc{matplotlib} (Hunter 2007), \textsc{astropy}, a community-developed core Python 
    package for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration et al., 2013), \textsc{photutils}, an 
    affiliated package of \textsc{astropy} for photometry, \textsc{aplpy}, an open-source 
    plotting package for Python hosted at http://aplpy.github.com, and \textsc{montage}, 
    funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number ACI-1440620, and 
    previously funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€™s Earth Science 
    Technology Office, Computation Technologies Project, under Cooperative Agreement 
    Number NCC5-626 between NASA and the California Institute of Technology.
